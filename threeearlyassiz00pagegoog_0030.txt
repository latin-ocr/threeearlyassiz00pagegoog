Penthea. XXV

An almost romantio story oi abduction occurs in the last
oi these rolls.¹ A certain lady, who is called both by the
name oi Dionisia de Bechfeld and of Dionisia de Ba, while
returning from Newcastle‚ where she had been in pledge
before Master de Seyton, accompanied by her uncle, Master

John de Papingham, when on Milburn Moor‚ near a bridge
called Opinetheleche, was met by a band oi young men, who
carried her off to a place called Illyscaghe in the Liberty of
Redesdale, where Walter de Swethop was steward3 and there

Walter de Swethop, iorssher husband. Upon her determined

they were acquitted. Fearing an attackin returniug through
Redesdule, she made an agreement with the forester ol

for the same in the Oourt oi Redesdale, which sum she for-
feited by default. By reason oi all this, she pleads, she was
damaged to the extent of 200 li. The matter in the end
appears to have been settled by the Swethops making a fine
with Dionisia for 20 marks, and with the King for 1008. Ι

or Ba was. From herpledges, via, John de Herle, Walter de
Tynedale‚ and John de Lethgreyns it would appear she was
a person of some standing in the county. 'Phe only additional
information I have found about her is that she was assessed
for 44⁸„ dd. on goods in Bechfeld for the subsidy in
