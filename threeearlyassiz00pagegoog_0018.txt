plees were taken in the Abbey of St. Mary of York, and later
in the same month in the porch of the Ohnrch (ia hostio

mclaioe) of the Blessed Peter of York, and in the colder ’
month of October the assiae court was held within the
Gathedral Church (infra arterium) of the Blessed Peter of
York.l In June of the same year an assiae was taken with-
out the walls of the E‘riars Preachers of Newcastlewithin
the liberty of the Prior of Tynemouth.2 It was a common
thing to take assizes, inquisitions, etc, on a Sunday, and we
find that the courts at Westminster sometimes sat on this

Resides the justices commissioned to take all pleas, there
visited the county justices for hearing Common Pleas only,
as in the case of the second of the rolls here printed. The
gaol of Newcastle was also periodically delivered, sometimes
by the sheriff and sometimes by judges specially com-
missioned.⁴ We get a little information from the rolls here
printed of the comitatae or county court, which was held at
Newcastle3 we learn that the comitatus was present at the
assiae court and recorded the customs of the county; it also
gave consent to provisions for the preservation of salmon.⁵

We find also that the owners of several baronies within the
county did suit at this court,⁶ and there are instances of
appeals of all kinds in the same court, at which the appellant
had to follow at the three county courts next after the deed
complained of was committed, otherwise his appeal failed.
A case illustrative of the county court will be found on
p. 195. Upon the complaint of a certain Geoffrey de Bol-
lesden the record of the proceedings of a county court was
ordered to be produced, from which it appears that Henry
de Beringdon claimed Geoffrey de Bollesden as his native
and fugitive, and said that his father was seized of the
grandfather of the said Geoffrey, and he produced a son of
