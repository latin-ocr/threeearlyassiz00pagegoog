ernour attempting to solve the involved question of the
origin of the various Courts 01 Justice in this country, it
may be well to trace the administration of justice in the
rounty 01 Northumberland from a date a little previous 10
that of the Assize Rolls here dealt with. The earliest men-
tion we have of any court held in the country north of the
Tees is that in which the Placito Comitatus were heard in
1080 at Gateshead‚ when Bishop Walcher, then Earl of
Northumberland, was murdered.

This Shiragemot, or Oounty (10001, 01 which the Plcoitu
Omnitatar were brought fcrward, was, till the forfaiture 01
Robert de Mowbray aud during the time the Earldom of
Northumberland was in the hands of Henry and Malcolm cf
Scotland, probably the highest, if not the only, court held in
the county. From the Pipe Rolls we learn that pleae were
held before Walter Espec and Eustace 1110 John in 1129, and
pleas 01 the forest in 1158. The Assize 01 Clarendon, which
remodelled the provincial administration of justice, was held
101166, aud almost immediately afterwards pleas for the
oounty of Northumberland were heard before Earl Geoffrey
de Mandeville and Richard de Lucy, the justiciar.¹ Ex-
cepting the inquest of sherifls in 1170, the next visitation 01
the justices to the oounty was in 1176, when pleas were held
before Rauulph Glanvill and his fellow-justices, described as
Juaticiarii 11000100,- 01 this assize the articles of the eyre
appear to have been very rigidly carried out, judging from
the long list of heavy fines then 100106.Β The King's justices
