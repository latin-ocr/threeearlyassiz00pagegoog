William de Valence, took 0 man who wished to replevy some
cattle, and put him in a cell until he had made a fine for his
release, and took another man and tied him to a post, and
refusedto let any one replevy him until the man's master had ¹
medea fine for four marks3 the jurors conclude by saying
that many other horrible prises he took from the men 01 the
eounty whereof there is no number.¹ Similar complaints

were also made against Gilbert de Umfravill and his bailiffs.
Α case 01 extraordinarily arbitrary conduct occurs in the
roll 10040 Heury III.2 Two women complained that Thomas
de Bikerton took them and another woman on suspicion 01
theft, and kept them in 0 0011 01 Bikerton for four days with-

near by, at which they could take sanctuary, and as 0000 00
the coroner could be brought to them they abjured the
realrn and made the best 01 their way to their native
country.

These rolls give us an idea 01 some 01 the industries and
trades 01 the inhabitants 01 Northumberland during the
