escaped with the slight punishment ot outlawry. On the
same roll we find 78 cases oi burglary, theft, etc, in twelve
of which cases the felons were hanged, in fourteen they
abjured the resim, and in the remaining 52 they escaped with
only the punishment of outlawry. In the Pleas of the
Orown for 7 Edward Ι. there are recorded 68 cases of
murder3 in which one murdcrer abjured the renim, two
were hanged, and 65 escaped with outlawry. On the same
roll are 110 cases of burglary, theit, etc, in 15 of which the
felons abjured in 20 they were hanged‚ and in the remain-
ing 75 they escaped with outlawry. The enormous per-
centage of unpunished crime which these figures shew is to
be largely accounted for by the peculiar position of the
county, from which it became a matter of comparative ease

for a telon to escape to some place where the King's writ
did not run. On the north was the Kingdom of scotland,
on the south the Palatinate of Durbam, and between these
were the small liberties of Hexham, Tynemouth‚ Tynedale,

Oarham and Norhamshire‚ Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire.
Of all these “ the Grithcros of Tynemouth ” was the worst
offender in receiving fugitive felons3 there were received
here not only malefactors from the county‚ but those fleeing
ior their misdeeds from other liberties.¹ The existence of such
franchises rendered the suppression oi felony in the county ex-
tremely difficult, if not impossible, and looking at these small
steens in this ugho, a is noe amusing enac the legislative
mind of Edward Ι. should have endeavoured to curtail their
power bytho Statutes of Westminster and Gloucester. This
ease of escape for felons necessitated a ready means of
punishing felony‚ somewhat aiter the style of Lynch law.
There are several instances ou these rolls of felons, caught
as it were red-handel, being beheaded on the spot without
any attempt nt a trial. From one of these it appears that a
stranger, named Gilbert de Niddesdal, while walking across
a certain moor with Semanus de Bottelesham‚ a hermit,
attacked and robbed him, and left him there stunned and
